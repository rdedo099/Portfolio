Steps for running the code for both Q1-1 and Q1-2:

1. Download and unzip repository

2. Open Assignment.java, Display.java and LinearRegression.java in a Java environment (DrJava was utilized for testing)

3. Compile all files

4. Run Assignment.java

<i>Note: In the terminal a small text box will appear, at each enter pressed in the textbox another iteration of the linear regression will occur. Q1-1 aims to have the generated line match with the given line, where Q1-2 aims to match the generated line with the data as the line of best fit. For Q1-2 the line of best fit is calculated and provided in the display.</i>
